## About me:
My first goal is to learn the frontend, in the future I want to learn the backend as well to be competitive when applying for jobs and to achieve higher positions.
My strength is reading and understanding other people’s code and a desire to learn new things. I also know English well enough to work and communicate with native speakers.

A couple of years ago I worked as a system administrator in a small company providing business process automation services. I have no experience in the programming field, but I have always strived for knowledge and studied what was related to my hobby. This is what prompted me to study data mining at one time. Also I love video games and someday wanted to get into game development.
